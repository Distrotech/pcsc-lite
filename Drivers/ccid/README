USB CCID IFD Handler
====================

  This package provides the source code for a generic USB CCID
(Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices) driver. See [1] for the USB CCID
specifications from the USB working group.


Authors:
========

- Ludovic Rousseau <ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>
- Carlos Prados for the PPS and ATR parsing code (taken from his
  towitoto driver) in towitoko/ directory.
- Olaf Kirch for the T=1 TPDU code (from the OpenCT package) in openct/
  directory. I (Ludovic Rousseau) greatly improved this code.


Supported CCID readers:
=======================

(in alphabetical order)
- Advanced Card Systems ACR 38 [16]
  old versions of this reader have a bug: the reader do timeout when a
  special USB frame is sent from the reader. If the frame size if a
  multiple of wMaxPacketSize the communication is stopped.
- Cherry XX33 keyboard [?]
- Dell keyboard SK-3106 [?]
- Dell smart card reader keyboard [?]

- SCM Micro SCR 331-DI [11]
  You shall upgrade the firmware [17] using version 6.22 or later.
- SCM Micro SCR 335 [7]
  The firmware of this reader can't be upgraded so be sure to buy a
  recent model with firmware 5.14 or later
- SCM Micro SPR 532 [9]
  You shall contact Torsten Maykranz <tmaykranz@scmmicro.de> to get a
  firmware upgrade.


Should work but untested by me:
===============================

I would like to get these readers to perform test and validation and
move them in the supported list above. If you are one of the
manufacturers, please, contact me.

- Cherry XX44 keyboard (SmartBoard G83-6744) [18] 
- ActivCard USB reader 2.0 [10]
- C3PO LTC32 [13]
- SCM Micro SCR 333 [15]
- Silitek SK-3105 keyboard [12] or C3PO TLTC2USB [14]


Unsupported or partly supported CCID readers:
=============================================

- C3PO LTC31 [8]
    The reader works fine with Linux kernel 2.4 but does not with Linux
    kernel 2.6. The ioctl() syscall returns EINVAL (Invalid argument)


Supported operating systems:
============================

- GNU/Linux (libusb 0.1.7)
- MacOS X/Darwin (libusb 0.1.8beta, CVS snapshot. See "Known problems")
  to libusb)


Debug informations:
===================

The driver uses the debug function provided by pcscd. So if pcscd sends
its debug to stdout (pcscd --foreground) then the CCID will also send
its debug to stdout. If pcscd sends its debug to syslog (by default)
then the CCID will also send its debug to syslog.

You can change the debug level using the Info.plist configuraion file.
The Info.plist is installed, by default, in
/usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist

The debug level is set in the ifdLogLevel field. It is a binary OR
combinaison of 4 different levels.
- 1: critical: important error messages
- 2: info:     informative messages like what reader was detected
- 4: periodic: periodic info when pcscd test if a card is present (every
               1/10 of a second)
- 8: comm:     a dump of all the bytes exchanged between the host and the
               reader

By default the debug level is set to 3 (1 + 2) and correspond to the
critical and info levels.

You have to restart the driver so it read the configuration file again
and use the new debug level value.  To restart the driver you just need
to unplug all your CCID readers so the the driver is unloaded and then
replug your readers. You can also restart pcscd.


Known problems:
===============

MacOSX libusb
"""""""""""""
    There is a bug in libusb that crash the libusb library when you
    unplug a reader and replug it in another USB socket.  So if you
    unplug a reader replug it in the same USB socket.

History:
========

0.9.2 - 15 August 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - T=1 TPDU code:
      . the work on T=1 TPDU code was possible thanks to Gemplus
        validation team who helped me test, debug and bring the code to
        an EMV validation level. Thanks to Jérôme, Jean-Yves, Xavier and
        the Gemplus readers department
      . error code was not checked correctly
      . avoid a (nearly) infinite loop when resynch are needed.
      . correctly initialise an internal value to allow more than one
        reader to work
    - multi-slots readers
      . add support for multi-slots readers. The only one I have is a
        SCM Micro SCR 331-DI with a contact and a contactless interface.
        The contactless interface may or may not work for you since the
        reader uses proprietary (undocumented) commands.
    - GemPC Twin serial reader
      . perform a command (get the reader firmware) to be sure a GemPC
        Twin (serial or pcmcia) reader is connected
      . use a dynamic timeout when reading the serial port.
        The first timeout used when detecting the reader is 2 seconds to
        not wait too long if no reader is connected. Later timeouts are
        set to 1 minute to allow long time APDU.
    - use `pkg-config libpcsclite --cflags` to locate the pcsc-lite
      header files
    - use `pkg-config --print-errors --atleast-version=1.2.9-beta5 libpcsclite`
      to test the pcsc-lite version
    - code improvements thanks to the splint tool (http://www.splint.org/)

0.9.1 - 1 July 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - I forgot to define IFD_PARITY_ERROR in a .h file

0.9.0 - 1 July 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - The T=1 TPDU automata from Carlos Prados' Towitoko driver is very
      limited and do not support error management mechanisms.
      I then used the T=1 TPDU automata from OpenCT (OpenSC project).
      This automata is much more powerful but still lacks a lot of error
      management code.
      I then added all the needed code to reach the quality level
      requested by the EMV standard.
    - add support for new readers:
      . Advanced Card Systems ACR 38
      . Cherry XX33
      . Dell keyboard SK-3106
      . Dell smart card reader keyboard
      . SCR 333
    - add support of multi procotol cards (T=0 and T=1)
    - the debug level is now dynamic and set in the Info.plist file (no
      need to recompile the driver any more)
    - add support for the libusb naming scheme: usb:%04x/%04x:libusb:%s
    - INSTALL: add a "configuring the driver for the serial reader
      (GemPC Twin)" part
    - use `pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir` so you do not
      have to use --enable-usbdropdir=DIR or --enable-ccidtwindir=DIR
      even if pcscd does not use the default /usr/local/pcsc/drivers
    - add support of IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE and
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN in IFDHControl()
    - read ifdDriverOptions from Info.plist to limit the use of
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE (idea from Peter Williams)
    - provide an example of use of SCardControl()
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_IFD_EXCHANGE and
      IOCTL_SMARTCARD_VENDOR_VERIFY_PIN in example/
    - add a --enable-pcsclite option (default to yes) so that the driver
      can be compiled for a different framework (one needing
      tokenparser.l like Solaris)
    - Reset action is power off and power on, not just power on
    - use the include files from pcsc-lite
    - add a mechanism to allow power on at 1.8V, 3V and then 5V as
      specified by ISO 7816. We still use 5V for now to avoid problems
      with non ISO compliant cards

0.4.1 - 14 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - distribute missing files readers/supported_readers.txt and
      src/create_Info_plist.pl
      'make install' failed because of this.

0.4.0 - 13 February 2004, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of T=1 with TPDU readers. A lot of the T=1 code comes from
      Carlos Prados towitoko driver.
      My code is GNU GPL, his code is GNU LGPL so the global driver is
      GNU GPL
    - PPS negotiation if the reader does not do it automatically
    - add support for the Silitek SK-3105 keyboard. It's a USB device
      with multiple interfaces
    - use the create_Info_plist.pl script to generate the installed
      Info.plist from an Info.plist template and a list of supported
      readers. The Info.plist was too "complex" to maintain by hand
      since it now contains 11 entries
    - add support of IFDHCreateChannelByName to avoid wrong reader
      enumeration. This is not complete if you have multiple _identical_
      readers. You need to use a > 1.2.0 pcsc-lite version (not yet
      released at that time)
    - build but do not install the serial ccidtwin driver by default
      since it is useless on computers without a serial port or without
      this reader for example.
    - read and write timeouts are not symmetric. write timout can be
      shorter since the reader and card is not supposed to do anything
      before receiving (write) a command
    - do not try to find usb.h and other libusb files if
      --disable-libusb is used. Needed if you only want to build the
      serial driver.  Thanks to Niki Waibel for the patch
    - add a --enable-ccidtwindir argument to ./configure to specify the
      serial GemPC Twin installation directory
    - debug and code improvements and simplifications

0.3.2 - 4 November 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - src/commands.c: correct a stupid bug that occurs with an APDU with
      2 bytes response.
    - Info.plist: add SPR 532 in list of supported readers
    - parse.c: do not exit if the InterfaceClass is 0xFF (proprietary).
      It is the case with old readers manufactured before the final
      release of the CCID specs.
    - move LTC31 reader from unsupported to supported reader list. It
      was my f ault since in used odd INS byte in my test applet and odd
      INS bytes are forbidden by ISO 7816-4 ch. 5.4.2 Instruction byte.
      Thanks to Josep Moné s Teixidor for pointing the problem.
    - src/commands.c: comment out the automatic GET RESPONSE part. I
      don't think it should be in the driver. Maybe in pcscd instead?

0.3.1 - 23 September 2003, Ludovic Rouseau
    - add --enable-multi-thread (enabled by default) for thread safe
      support an APDU multiplexing. You will need pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc3 or
      above to use this feature.
    - add --enable-libusb=PATH option is your libusb is not installed in
      /usr or /usr/local
    - honor DESTDIR in install rules (closes [ #300110 ]). Thanks to
      Ville Skyttä for the patch.
    - src/ccid.c: do not switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU
      mode since it also swicth in EMV mode and may not work with non
      EMV cards
    - src/ccid_serial.c: complete reimplementation of the Twin serial
      protocol using a finite state automata (code much simpler)

0.3.0 - 10 September 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - support of GemPC Twin connected to a serial port. Thanks to Niki
      W. Waibel for a working prototype.
    - support of auto voltage at power up if the reader support it
      instead of forcing a 5V in all cases.
    - support of APDU mode instead of just TPDU if the reader support
      it. Thanks to Jean-Luc Giraud for the idea and inspiration I got
      from his "concurrent" driver.
    - support of "time request" from the card.
    - parse: new indentation for more readability of supported features.
    - switch the GemPC Key and GemPC Twin in APDU mode since they
      support it but do not announce it in the dwFeatures.
    - new build process using autoconf/automake.

0.2.0 - 26 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - Works under MacOS X
    - Info.plist: use an <array></array> for the alias enumeration
    - Makefile rework for *BSD and MacOS X

0.1.0 - 13 August 2003, Ludovic Rousseau
    - First public release
