SECURITY

This file will discuss security related issues with pcsc-lite and how to
handle them.

Sometimes it is dangerous to run daemons under a root account.  If there is
a chance to exploit a buffer overflow you can protect sensitive information 
by running it under a different account. It might be useful to create another
user with hardware priveledges and run pcscd as that user.  Be sure this user
can manipulate the server sockets.


Application suggestions:

Recycle SCARDHANDLE's.  It is not good practice to call SCardConnect and wait
for something to occur.  Make your connections short so that your handle
does not become stale and heighten the chance of session guessing.  1.0.0 
releases bind sessions with sockets so other processes cannot guess handles.

Make sure you Disconnect when you are not using the reader.  Also be sure to
ReleaseContext before exiting your program.
