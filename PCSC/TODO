- do not use an active polling in hotplug_libusb.c (USB devices scanned
  every 1 second) but use a udev trigger mechanism or something similar
  (mimic hotplug_macosx.c)
  See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=205182

- improve performances between pcscd and libpcsclite
  see http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2005-q4/0086.html

- include Apple patches and improvements (if possible/needed)

- power on the card _only_ if an application requests a connection
  see Alioth bug #301965

- use a callback from IFD handler to pcscd instead of polling to get the
  card status: better performance, possible lower power consumption

- allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two different machines.
  That would be needed to support remote PAM login.
  Maybe use unix2tcp (http://dizzy.roedu.net/unix2tcp/)

- manage power suspend/resume (in a laptop for example) and coordinate
  with the driver (when/if possible)
