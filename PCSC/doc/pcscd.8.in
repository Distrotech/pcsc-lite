.SH DESCRIPTION
pcscd is the daemon program for PC/SC Lite and MUSCLE Card. It is a resource 
manager that coordinates communications with smart-card readers and smart 
cards that are connected to the system.

pcscd is normally started at boot from 
.I /etc/rc.  
It allows applications to access smart cards and readers without knowing details of the card or reader.  

pcscd coordinates the loading of drivers for card readers and plug-ins 
for different card types.

The purpose of PC/SC Lite is to provide a Windows(R) SCard interface in 
a very small form factor for communicating to smartcards and readers.  
PC/SC Lite can be used to allocate/deallocate reader drivers dynamically 
at runtime.

PC/SC Lite uses the same winscard api as used under Windows(R).

At startup, pcscd loads the smart card reader drivers specified in the 
.I usr/local/etc/reader.conf 
file.  

When a smart card is inserted into a reader, pcscd uses the ATR string from 
the card to identify this card.  The 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/serices 
directory contains plug-ins for the card.  These plug-ins are searched.  If 
the ATR string matches, pcscd loads that plug-in for the card.
.SH "SERIAL SMART CARD READER DRIVERS"
Smart card reader drivers are placed in the 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/drivers 
directory. Each driver is simply an 
.I *.so 
file.  The pcscd locates the driver with the 
.I usr/local/etc/reader.conf 
file.  The file has the following format:

.IP FRIENDLYNAME 
is a user-friendly name of the reader that is served by this driver. This name is displayed to the user when necessary.

.IP DEVICENAME 
is a driver specific value.  If you do not know this value, GEN_SMART_RDR is a good choice.
	
.IP LIBPATH 
is the full path to the shared library. 

.IP CHANNELID

.SH "SMART CARD PLUG-INS"
pcscd uses plug-ins to handle different types of smart cards. There is a 
plug-in for each smart-card type. Plug-ins are installed in the 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/services 
directory.  pcscd comes with the plug-in for CAC card smart cards. Plug-ins 
for other card types are available.
