.SH DESCRIPTION
pcscd is the daemon program for pcsc-lite and musclecard framework. It is 
a resource manager that coordinates communications with smart-card readers 
and smart cards and cryptographic tokens that are connected to the system.

pcscd is normally started at boot from 
.I /etc/rc.  
It allows applications to access smart cards and readers without knowing details of the card or reader.  

pcscd coordinates the loading of drivers for card readers and plug-ins 
for different card types.

The purpose of pcsc-lite is to provide both a cross compatible API for
migrating Windows based PCSC applications to Unix and to provide a 
pluggable architecture for supporting smartcards and cryptographic tokens 
through high level API's.

At startup, pcscd loads the smart card reader drivers specified in the 
.I /etc/reader.conf 
file.  

When a smart card is inserted into a reader, pcscd uses the ATR string from 
the card to identify this card.  The 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/serices 
directory contains plug-ins for the card.  These plug-ins are searched.  If 
the ATR string matches, the client library loads that plug-in for that 
token.
.SH "SERIAL SMART CARD READER DRIVERS"
Smart card reader drivers are placed in the 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/drivers 
directory. Each driver is simply an 
.I *.so 
file.  The pcscd locates the driver with the 
.I usr/local/etc/reader.conf 
file.  The file has the following format:

.RS
# Configuration file for pcsc-lite
.RE

# Comment Line 

FRIENDLYNAME	"My Smartcard Reader"
.RE
.RS
DEVICENAME	GEN_SMART_RDR
.RE

.RE

# End of file
.RE

.IP FRIENDLYNAME 
is a user-friendly name of the reader that is served by this driver. This name is displayed to the user when necessary.

.IP DEVICENAME 
is a driver specific value.  If you do not know this value, GEN_SMART_RDR is a good choice.
	
.IP LIBPATH 
is the full path to the shared library. 

.IP CHANNELID 
is the channel ID for serial-port, smart-card readers.  This could vary 
depending on the driver in which you are using - check the driver README
for more information.  Some use the following:

.RS 
COM1     0x0103F8
.RE 
.RS  
COM2     0x0102F8
.RE 
.RS 
COM3     0x0103E8
.RE
.RS 
COM4     0x0102E8

Multiple drivers can be listed in 
.I usr/local/etc/reader.conf.

Drivers are available at http://www.musclecard.com
.SH "SMART CARD PLUG-INS"
pcsc-lite uses plug-ins to handle different types of smart cards. There is 
a plug-in for each smart-card type. Plug-ins are installed in the 
.I /usr/local/pcsc/services 
directory.  Plug-ins for cards/tokens are available from the MUSCLE
web site [http://www.musclecard.com].
