Name   : IFD Test Suite for PC/SC Lite
Purpose: This program provides a driver validation
         sequence for validating drivers on Unix OS's
         and PC/SC Lite


To use this tester you must have a set of PC/SC test suite cards.  This 
test is nearly identical to that which is done by Microsoft's WHQL Group 
and can be used to verify the quality of your driver for use with 
pcsc-lite.  For those familiar with IFDTEST.EXE this will be no different.
