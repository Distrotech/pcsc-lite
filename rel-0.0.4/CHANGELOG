ChangeLog for Pycsc:

v 0.0.4:
-----
Thanks to Arah Leonard::
- Made pcsc_stringify_error a little more informative by including a
string equivalent of the error code.
- Made pycscobject_pycsc slightly more flexible in that it works the same
as before except that it will now also autoconnect to the first avaialble
reader if you give it an empty reader name string.  (I found it convenient
when you want the option of specifying a reader name but want the code to be
identical to if no reader name was specified.)
- Added more constants to initpycsc.

Thanks to Robert HÃ¶zl:
- More pcsc_stringify_error for Win32 
- Support for compilation using Borland C++
- More defined constants
- SCardGetAttributes and SCardSetAtttributes
- SCardControl 

Thanks to Bashkar:
- Comments on each function

Thanks to Philippe C Martin:
- Improvement to pycsc_control

TODO from Philippe: 
- pycscobject_getCtlCode <--- Why is this necessary? SCARD_CTL_CODE not on Mac
- tag_PIN_VERIFY_STRUCTURE
See other C file


v 0.3:
-----

- one setup.py for all platforms
- added minimal pcsc_stringify_error for Win32 (thanks to Arah Leonard)
- calling constructor with no args or "" is now similar (thanks to Arah Leonard)
- defined more constants (thanks to Arah Leonard)
