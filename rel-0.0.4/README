Python wrapper to use with pcsclite
===================================

This package implements a new python type to communicate with smart cards.
It relies on a working installation of pcscd (see http://www.musclecard.com).

The communication level is very low (ADPU) so you are expected to be quite
knowledgeable on smart cards to be able to make any use of this package.

Limitations:
============

This is a very early prototype and lots of things are not implemented 
(particularly all the error management). They will hopefully be added in the
near future. 

The package is NOT thread safe.

On the function getStatusChange: Windows has a different behaviour from
pcsc-lite. The safe way to use this function is to first run it to 
query the EventState and the call it again with the returned EventSate
as CurrentState (see example.py)
