  "pcsclite.h" since the local .h should be more recent and with less
  bugs than the one in /usr/local/include/

pcsc-lite-1.0.2beta: (Ludovic Rousseau)
29 Nov, 2001
- stop if /tmp/pcsc already exists
- clean and remove /tmp/pcsc on exit using signal() and atexit()
- renamed SYS_Exit to exit in many places to use the atexit() defined
  cleaning function
- removed \n in debug messages (syslog does not need it)
- some minor print cosmetic modification in atrhandler.c
- use a define DEBUG_BUFFER_LENGTH instead of 150 in debuglog.c
- use snprintf() instead of sprintf() in debuglog.c
- add a error on compile in pcscdaemon.c
   You must use '--enable-syslog' when also using '--enable-daemon' or
   you will not get any message
- renamed SYS_Stat to SYS_Fstat since the system call is fstat and stat
  is another one
- use PCSCLITE_IPC_DIR instead of repeating "/tmp/pcsc/" in pcsclite.h
