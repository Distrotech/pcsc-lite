- ATR_analysis (Christophe Levantis and Ludovic Rousseau)
    Perl script used to parse the smart card ATR.
    This script is called (by default) by pcsc_scan

    This code was written in August 2000 for a Perl wrapper using "TLP
	driver" (and not PC/SC) to access the smartcard.

- scriptor (Lionel Victor <lionel.victor@unforgettable.com>)
    A Perl script to send commands to a smart card. You can use a file
    containing the commands or stdin.

- gscriptor (Lionel Victor <lionel.victor@unforgettable.com>)
    A Perl script to send commands to a smart card with GTK-based
    graphical interface.

You will need the package pcsc-perl [3] to be able to use scriptor and
gscriptor.
