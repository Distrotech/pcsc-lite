// exporting from a DLL simpler. All files within this DLL are compiled with
// the PCSC_EXPORTS symbol defined on the command line. this symbol should not
// be defined on any project that uses this DLL. This way any other project
// whose source files include this file see PCSC_API functions as being
// imported from a DLL, wheras this DLL sees symbols defined with this macro as
// being exported.
