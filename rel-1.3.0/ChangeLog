pcsc-lite-1.3.0: Ludovic Rousseau
3 March 2006
- new official stable version since 1.2.0 in October 2003. Many thanks
  to all the bug reporters and bug fixers
- libmusclecard is now in a independenant package
- (re)allow compilation on Solaris
- SCardReleaseContext(): do not check that the thread releasing the
  context is the one that established it. This check is not performed on
  Windows and creates portability problems See
  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0134.html
- automatically call SCardUnload() when the libpcsclite library is
  unloaded Thanks to Najam Siddiqui. See
  http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/dev/muscle/2006-q1/0177.html
- some other minor improvements and bug corrections


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta10: Ludovic Rousseau
3 February 2006
- if the USB reader defines a serial number then include it in the
  reader name (between parenthesis)
- the library libpcsclite.so.1 only exports the symbols defined by the
  API (http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/pcsc-lite/). This is needed to
  be able to use the library in an appliation that also uses flex (like
  muscleTool). The problem only occurs with GCC >= 4.0
- some other minor improvements and bug corrections


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta9: Ludovic Rousseau
27 November 2005
- add/improve support of PIN pad readers
  . define HOST_TO_CCID_16() and HOST_TO_CCID_32() macro to convert 16 and
    32-bits data to the CCID format (replace HOST_TO_CCID)
- add support of SUN C compiler and try to avoid GCC specific features
  (Heiko Nardmann)
- SCardGetStatusChange(): 
  . exists if the list of readers changed (one reader added) so that the
    application can update its list of readers (Najam Siddiqui)
  . correct a bug when two contexts where used (Najam Siddiqui)
- add support of Solaris 10 IFDhandler (Douglas E. Engert)
- allow pcsc-lite to be compiled without (f)lex installed
- add a TODO file. Help/money needed here.
- improve Doxygen documentation
- some other minor improvements and bug corrections


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta8: Ludovic Rousseau
6 September 2005
- correct a crash on Fedora Core 4 (off by 1 buffer overflow)
- do not silently truncate the reader, library or device name if they
  are too long but display an error message instead
- reinclude musclecard library in pcsc-lite package since a lot of code
  is shared. The separation was a mistake
- add colorization of the logs when sent to stderr. The color depends on
  the priority level
- restrict the number of symbols (function names) exported from
  libpcsclite.so to limit symbol conflicts with other libraries. Only
  the PC/SC API symbols should be exported
- add Doxygen documentation. Thanks to Luiz Reuter Silva Torro.
  HTML pages available at
  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/doxygen/html/index.html
- SCardControl(): a 0 byte long pbSendBuffer is no more rejected since
  the command is in dwControlCode. Thanks to Martin Paljak for the patch
- provide a reader.h file (by default in /usr/local/include/PCSC/reader.h)
  that contains definitions shared between an application and a smart
  card driver (like SCARD_CTL_CODE, CM_IOCTL_GET_FEATURE_REQUEST,
  FEATURE_* and HOST_TO_CCID)
- pcscd: allow a serial hotplug by sending a SIGUSR1 signal. The
  /etc/reader.conf file is re-read and reader presence/abscence is updated
- musclecard library: small bug fixes
- pcsc-lite SCF: small bug fixes
- some other minor improvements and bug corrections


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta7: Ludovic Rousseau
2 March 2005
- SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY is defined as (SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0|SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1)
  You should not use SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY since it is not defined in
  Windows PC/SC. It is just defined for backward source code compatibility
- define SCARD_STATE_UNPOWERED even it is a state never used so source
  code using it can compile
- SCardStatus(): pdwState and pdwProtocol parameters may be NULL (mimic
  Windows)
- provide a script update-reader.conf to update the /etc/reader.conf
  file from /etc/reader.conf.d/* files
  This script is called by /etc/init.d/pcscd before starting the daemon
- add support of SCardGetAttrib() with a NULL pbAttr parameter to only
  get the needed lenth in pcbAttrLen
- SCardReconnect() now works after a card movement.  Previously
  SCardReconnect() returned "Card was removed" even if the new card is
  reseted.
- SCardGetStatusChange(): greatly improve performances. Thanks to Oivind
  H. Danielsen
- SCardControl(): check if the pbSendBuffer is NULL or no bytes are sent
  for driver API v2 only. With API v3 we can use dwControlCode as the
  only data to send.
- Implement the dynamic level logging in pcscd
  The new command line options are:
    -d, --debug           display lower level debug messages
        --info            display info level debug messages (default level)
        --error           display error level debug messages
        --critical        display critical only level debug messages
- some documentation update


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta6: Ludovic Rousseau
15 August 2004
- The debug messages are now displayed by default. This prevented error
  messages generated by a wrong /etc/reader.conf parsing to be displayed
- thread management:
  . threads are now created with the PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED attribute
    so that resources are released when the thread ends. Thanks to
    Michael Gold for the patch.
    Previous versions of pcscd just died after 256 clients connections.
- remove PCSC/ from the header files path since the path is given by
  pkg-config --cflags libpcsclite or the correct -I directive
- src/winscard_svc.c:
  . MSGCleanupClient(): always reset all the fields. Thanks to Michael
    Gold for the patch.
- src/configfile.l:
  . if the file referenced by DEVICENAME can't be use (because it is not
    a correct filename) we now display:
    You should use 'DEVICENAME /dev/null' if your driver does not use this field
- src/winscard.c:
  . Avoid generating a PPS request that would not be just after a power
    up. The previous code worked only when the card was _reseted_ at
    SCardDisconnect() but not when SCARD_LEAVE_CARD was used.
- correctly manage multi-slots readers
- etc/pcscd.init:
  . updated to reflect the RPM version. Thanks to Ville Skyttä & Fritz Elfert
- doc/example/pcsc_demo.c:
  . add SCardTransmit() code sample
- src/testpcsc.c:
  . add a "(don't panic)" after a "Transaction failed." if it is not a
    critical failure.
- doc/pcsc-lite.tex:
  . the function SCardSetTimeout() is deprecated and does nothing
- doc/ifdhandler-3.tex:
  . add documentation for IFDHGetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_THREAD_SAFE, ...),
    IFDHGetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_SLOT_THREAD_SAFE, ...) and
    IFDHSetCapabilities(..., TAG_IFD_SLOTNUM, ...)
- some internal changes and bugs corrections


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta5: Ludovic Rousseau
16 July 2004
- src/PCSC/wintypes.h:
  . add type LPSTR (again) so that "old" drivers and applications can
    compile but mark the type deprecated.
    See http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.1/gcc/Type-Attributes.html
- src/tokenfactory.c:
  . TPSearchBundlesForAtr(): use "%s/%s" insead of "%s%s" when
    generating the MuscleCard bundle name on MacOSX
- src/winscard.c:
  . SCardControl() (new API) can now be used with a IFDHandler v2.0 or v3.0.
    The previous code was broken and only worked with an IFDHandler v3.0
    (crashed with a v2.0).
- src/PCSC/ifdhandler.h:
  . IFDHControl(): use PUCHAR instead of LPCVOID and LPVOID so the
    driver can use TxBuffer[x] without needing a cast.
  . it is now possible to compile a IFDHandler v2.0 with this include
    file.  Just #define IFDHANDLERv2 in your source code before
    #include <ifdhandler.h>
    By default it is setup for for most recent version of the API (V3.0)


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta4: Ludovic Rousseau
3 July 2004
- src/libmusclecard.pc.in and src/libpcsclite.pc.in
  . includedir is now @includedir@/PCSC
  . add pthread flags for compilation and link
  . thanks to Ville Skyttä for these patches.
    They are small but are mandatory to (re)compile muscleTools (and
    others) without modification to their Makefile.


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta3: Ludovic Rousseau
30 June 2004
- src/hotplug_libusb.c:
  . use a dynamic array for available USB drivers:
   - avoid a buffer overflow (argh!)
   - allow to use more than 16 drivers/supported readers
- src/Makefile.am:
  . install mscdefines.h, winscard.h, musclecard.h, pcsclite.h and wintypes.h
    in /usr/include/PCSC/ to not pollute /usr/include/
  . install ifdhandler.h, debuglog.h and parser.h in /usr/include/PCSC/ so
    drivers can use them for compilation.
  Modify your source code or add -I/usr/include/PCSC to CFLAGS in your
  Makefile or, better, use CFLAGS=`pkg-config libpcsclite --cflags`
- doc/pcsc-lite.tex:
  . dwPreferredProtocols is a bit mask of acceptable protocols
  . SCARD_SHARE_DIRECT can be used to talk to the reader without a card
    inserted
  . add "Some SCardControl commands" section (IFD_EXCHANGE and VERIFY_PIN)
  . add documentation for LTPBundleFindValueWithKey(), debug_msg() and
    debug_xxd()
- src/configfile.l: (/etc/reader.conf parser):
  . allow ':' in DEVICENAME. use ':' to indicate a non-real device (pcscd does
    not test for its existence as a file).  You can use this in something like
    "net://1.2.3.4/foobar" to indicate a reader on a remote machine like an
    X11 terminal.
- src/PCSC/wintypes.h:
  . Change the names of the types LPCSTR to LPCTSTR and LPSTR to LPTSTR to be
    compliant with the Microsoft SCard API. You will have to update your
    source codes.
- src/readerfactory.c:
  . rework RFSetReaderName() to simply the code and always start with the
    lowest number available (like in previous pcsc-lite version)
- src/prothandler.c:
  . completely redesign the function so that IFDSetPTS() is always called to
    tell the driver which protocol to use and to initialise its internal
    state. The driver now knows which protocol (T=0 or T=1) the application
    wants to use even if the card only support only one protocol.
- src/atrhandler.c:
  . add support of specific mode by the presence of TA2 (protocol not
    negociable)
- src/utils/Makefile.am:
  . install bundleTool and installifd in [...]/sbin/ instead of [...]/bin/
- doc/example/Makefile.am:
  . do not install pcsc_demo since it is just a sample code for developpers
    that is not supposed (the code) to do anything useful
- doc/example/pcsc_demo.c:
  . replace SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY by SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0 | SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1 since
    SCARD_PROTOCOL_ANY is _not_ defined by Microsoft PC/SC and is not equals
    to SCARD_PROTOCOL_T0 | SCARD_PROTOCOL_T1 in pcsc-lite
- and lots of other minor and/or internal only changes

pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta2: Ludovic Rousseau
11 May 2004
- change libmusclecard current version to 1 so that old libmusclecard0 and new
  libmusclecard1 can cohabit on the same system and will not break existing
  programs during upgrades.

  This is because libmusclecard is provided in the same distrib/package as
  libpcsclite. If we want two libpcsclite to cohabit we must also ensure
  that the two libmusclecard can also cohabit.
- src/pcscdaemon.c: print pcsc-lite version number during startup
- src/winscard.c: in SCardReconnect(), SCardDisconnect() and
  SCardEndTransaction() SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD is "Power down the card and reset
  it (Cold Reset)" so we really power down _and_ then power up the card.
- doc/pcsc-lite.tex: add the chapter "Multithreading and contexts"
- doc/ifdhandler-3.tex: IFD Handler API in LaTeX format
- correct some minor typos in documentation and output texts


pcsc-lite-1.2.9-beta1: Ludovic Rousseau
6 May 2004
- configure: add support of --enable-extendedapdu argument to allow the use of
  big APDUs (APDU size between 256-Bytes and 128-KBytes)
- API changes:
  . SCardControl() API changed to be similar to the Microsoft PC/SC
    implementation
  . add SCardGetAttrib()/SCardSetAttrib() functions
  . the driver need to be compliant to IFDHandler API v3 to support these new
    functions
- multithreading:
  Damien Sauveron added the support of multiplexing multi-readers
  communications. In the previous version the communications were serialized
  and not simultaneous even if it was not needed. Thanks Damien.
- src/pcscdaemon.c:
  . remove the warning if no /etc/reader.conf is found. It is normal to not
    have an /etc/reader.conf for USB readers only.
  . send debug to syslog by default
  . send debug to stderr if --foreground|-f is used (no need to add
    --debug stderr anymore)
- doc/pcsc-lite.pdf: doc improved to add the new functions and API. The doc is
  now generated from a LaTeX file (easier to maintain, html version available,
  much more nice, etc.)
- src/testpcsc.c:
  . added tests for the new functions SCardGetAttrib(), SCardSetAttrib() and
    SCardControl() and also the old SCardListReaderGroups()
  . do not ask for reader number if only one reader is present
  . some more debug
- pcscd and libpcsclite now exchange a protocol version to know what API to
  use. This will be useful if/when the API change again
- change library version to 1:0:0 since the interface changed
- hotplug: the daemon pcscd do not try to restart drivers anymore when it is
  exiting
- src/hotplug_libusb.c:
  . do not try to restart a USB driver if the first execution fails (because
    of a bug in the driver or whatever) since the next execution of the driver
    will, with a great probability, also fail. The user has to unplug/replug
    the reader to restart the driver. This prevents to fill the system logs
    with an error message every 1 second.
  . use deviceName defined as usb:idVendor/idProduct:libusb:busname:filename
    in HPAddHotPluggable(). This should avoid wrong USB enumeration when used
    in IFDHCreateChannelByName()
- src/hotplug_macosx.c:
  . buffer overflow: the driver list was not terminated and caused crashes.
- src/winscard.c:
  . remove the code to map SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD on IFD_RESET.
    SCARD_UNPOWER_CARD is power down and power up (cold reset) => IFD_POWER_DOWN
    SCARD_RESET_CARD is just power up (warm reset) => IFD_RESET
- src/winscard.h:
  . use SCARDCONTEXT, DWORD, LPSCARDHANDLE, etc. instead of long, unsigned
    long, long *, etc. to be more Windows PC/SC compliant
- doc/reader.conf.5.in: new manpage to make it clear that this configuration
  file SHOULD not be used for USB readers
- src/configfile.l:
  . print a warning if the LIBPATH contains ".bundle". USB drivers SHOULD NOT
    be declared in reader.conf
  . Check that DEVICENAME and LIBPATH files exist and if an error occurs
    during the parsing the reader is not added and pcscd exit.
- doc/example/pcsc_demo.c:
  . recode the readers enumeration to avoid the use of
    PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS. You do not and should not need
    PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS_CONTEXTS. Use a dynamic management instead.
  . add SCardReconnect() sample code
  . allow to select the reader number instead of always selecting the first
    reader
  . some minor debug
- src/musclecard.c:
  . Initialize currentToken->tokenType in MSCListTokens(). Closes "[ #300607 ]
    MSCListTokens should set tokenType to know state before OR operation"
- src/tokenfactory.c:
  . correct atrString[] buffer size. The ATR is in ASCII so it must be
    MAX_ATR_SIZE*2 +1. This was problematic for cards with a "long" ATR.
- src/readerfactory.c:
  . initialize vHandle field to NULL in RFAllocateReaderSpace() (caused a
    crash under MacOS X)
- aclocal/acx_pthread.m4:
  . new upstream version to avoid checking for pthread.h which does not exist
    on *BSD
- src/libmusclecard.pc.in, src/libpcsclite.pc.in:
  . add muscledropdir (in libmusclecard) and usbdropdir (in libpcsclite) so we
    can use `pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir` to find the
    directory to use. Should be used by drivers and plugins installation.
    Thanks to Ville Skyttä for the patch.
- many other minor patches and corrections. Read ChangeLog.cvs for a complete
  list


pcsc-lite-1.2.0: Ludovic Rousseau
27 october, 2003
- the 1.2.0 version is the same as 1.2.0-rc3 version

pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc3: Ludovic Rousseau
15 october, 2003
- src/winscard_msg.c: perform a round-robbin among clients to avoid starvation
  under heavy load. Patch from Bettina Martelli.
- src/winscard_clnt.c: send debug to stdout only if the environment variable
  MUSCLECARD_DEBUG is defined
- src/libmusclecard.pc.in: add a new pkg-config file for application using
  libmusclecard.
- a lot of code and build clean up by Antti Tapaninen
- some code clean up and debug by Damien Sauveron


pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc2: Ludovic Rousseau
4 September, 2003
- removed a very _stupid_ bug that linked libpcsclite with libusb. Any
  application linked with libpcsclite was also linked with libusb.
- generate a new library libmusclecard and remove MuscleCard code from
  libpcsclite. An application using MuscleCard functions needs to explicitly
  link with libmusclecard.
- src/winscard_clnt.c: add a new function SCardUnload() to free allocated
  resources. It is mandatory only if you use dlopen/dlclose to often
  load/unload the library.  Otherwi se you will exhaust the ressources
  available and get a crash.  Thanks to Guy Moreillon for the patch.
- src/muscletest.c: code cleaning


pcsc-lite-1.2.0-rc1: Ludovic Rousseau
26 August, 2003
- configure.in: --enable-usb is now deprecated and off by default.
  --enable-libusb is selected by default and will be used if libusb is
  installed in /usr. If libusb is installed in /usr/local use
  --enable-libusb=/usr/local
- src/hotplug_macosx.c: Add support of reader aliases using <array></array> in
  driver Info.plist on MacOS X.
  The old syntax did not work since pcscd on MacOS X wants a correct XML file.
  The new syntax is:
    <key>ifdVendorID</key>
    <array>
        <string>0x08E6</string> <!-- 1, Gemplus -->
        <string>0x04E6</string> <!-- 2, SCM Microsystems -->
        <string>0x076B</string> <!-- 3, OmniKey -->
        <string>0x0783</string> <!-- 4, C3PO -->
    </array>

    <key>ifdProductID</key>
    <array>
        <string>0x3437</string> <!-- 1 -->
        <string>0x5115</string> <!-- 2 -->
        <string>0x3021</string> <!-- 3 -->
        <string>0x0003</string> <!-- 4 -->
    </array>

    <key>ifdFriendlyName</key>
    <array>
        <string>GemPC Twin</string>   <!-- 1 -->
        <string>SCR 335</string>      <!-- 2 -->
        <string>CardMan 3121</string> <!-- 3 -->
        <string>LTC31</string>        <!-- 4 -->
    </array>
- src/powermgt_macosx.c, src/hotplug_macosx.c and some others: Add support of
  PCMCIA for MacOS X. Thanks to Stephen M. Webb.
- src/hotplug_libusb.c: Add support of libusb. Allow to use USB readers on
  *BSD or any plateform supported by libusb. Thanks to Toni Andjelkovic for
  the great job.
  I also redesigned the code to support up to PCSCLITE_MAX_READERS readers
  whatever the driver they use.
- src/musclecard.c:
  . fix an initialisation problem of pConnection->shareMode (thanks to Wan-Teh
  Chang)
  . avoid a memory leak (Toni Andjelkovic)
- doc/example: sample demo application using pcsc-lite API
- src/winscard.c:
  . pcscd reported card is present when there is no card in the reader
  . return SCARD_E_INVALID_PARAMETER for APDU of less than 4 bytes
- src/winscard_svc.c: Sometimes unknown APDUs were being transmitted when
  'SCardStatus' function was invoked
- some code cleanup and compilation problems removed.


pcsc-lite-1.1.2beta5: Ludovic Rousseau
30 May, 2003
- src/winscard.c: SCardStatus(): do not return before filling buffers
- src/winscard_clnt.c: SCardStatusTH(): simplify code and return correct
  results when buffers are too short or NULL is used
- src/libpcsclite.pc.in: used to generated a pkg-config ".pc" file (thanks to
  Andreas Jellinghaus for the idea and the patch)
- configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/utils/installifd.c, doc/bundleTool.8.in,
  doc/pcscd.8.in, etc/reader.conf.in:
  . correct typos and include path configured by ./configure appear in the
  docs (thanks to Ville Skyttä)
- src/utils/installifd.c:
  . replace gets() by fgets() to avoid buffer overflow.
  . Use sizeof() instead of constants.
  . do not use strdup() since it is useless.
  . print error messages when needed.


pcsc-lite-1.1.2beta4: Ludovic Rousseau
13 Apr, 2003
- src/debuglog.c:
  . DebugLogSetLogType() set flags and not just _or_ them (allow unset)
  . use strncpy to avoid a possible buffer overflow
- src/hotplug_linux.c:
  . code cleanup
  . support for driver aliases in Info.plist. The syntax is:
        <key>ifdProductString</key>
        <string>GemPC430</string>

        <key>ifdVendorID</key>
        <string>0x08E6</string>
        <string>0x08E6</string>
        <string>0x08E6</string>

        <key>ifdProductID</key>
        <string>0x0430</string>
        <string>0x0432</string>
        <string>0x0435</string>

        <key>ifdFriendlyName</key>
        <string>GemPC430</string>
        <string>GemPC432</string>
        <string>GemPC435</string>
    So this driver will be used by the three possible readers.
- src/Makefile.am:
  . support for driver aliases in Info.plist (use tokenparser.l instead of
    driverparser.l)
  . support for xBSD back
- src/pcsclite.h:
  . rename "pcsc.pub" and "pcsc.comm" in "pcscd.pub" and "pcscd.comm"

- Support for Sun Microsystems' SCF
- Patches from Dmitry Djachenko to:
  . init g_rgSCard??Pci variable at compile time
  . return more meaningfull error codes in SCardReconnect()
  . return more information in SCardStatus()
  . accept pioRecvPci == NULL in SCardTransmit()
    according to MSDN (July 2002) : SCardTransmit description
     pioRecvPci
      [in, out] Pointer to the protocol header structure for the instruction,
      followed by a buffer in which to receive any returned protocol control
      information (PCI) specific to the protocol in use. This parameter may be
      NULL if no returned PCI is desired.
- correct an overflow in SCardGetStatusChange(). Thanks to Michael Nidd
- configure.in, src/pcscdaemon.c, src/pcsclite.h:
  . add --enable-ipcdir=DIR option. Default is now /var/run/ instead of
  /tmp/pcsc/
- src/Makefile.am:
  . reorganise conditionals to to have a src/Makefile.in file 142 (yes 142)
  times smaller (33 KB instead of 4.7 MB)
- src/eventhandler.c:
  . add filename and error message to error logs for /var/run/pcsc.pub
- src/debuglog.h:

pcsc-lite-1.0.2beta: (Ludovic Rousseau)
29 Nov, 2001
- stop if /tmp/pcsc already exists
- clean and remove /tmp/pcsc on exit using signal() and atexit()
- renamed SYS_Exit to exit in many places to use the atexit() defined
  cleaning function
- removed \n in debug messages (syslog does not need it)
