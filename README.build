This is Solaris-specific version of PC/SC-Lite that has been re-architected
with security and scalability enhancements to support larger installs
beyond just single user machines -- for example thin client networks.

Some of the changes were necessitated by the requirement that PC/SC-Lite
run under the security constraints of Solaris Trusted Extensions and
Solaris Zones.

For more information about the re-design, please see the file
SECURITY_SCALABILITY_ENHANCEMENTS.pdf in this branch.

PREPARING THE SOLARIS 10 BUILD MACHINE:
--------------------------------------

This workspace is setup to build the package "SolarisPCSC" on a 
Solaris 10 system.   The hope is that this code will ultimately be
merged back into the trunk, but there is some work involved in doing
that as is explained in SECURITY_SCALABILITY_ENHANCEMENTS.pdf.

To build with the pre-set configuration provided in this workspace
in the buildenv folder, the following need to be present on the build
machine:

	Sun Studio 11 (gcc works if buildenv tweaked)
	Solaris 10 Companion Software (from sun.com).

The following utilities supporting autoconf and automake should
be present on the system.  If acceptable versions of these
utilities are found in /opt/sfw (from the Solaris Companion Software),
you will need to modify the path in the buildenv directory to find them,
because the minimum working versions were not when this build
environment was originally created.

So you may need to require these or later version from the Internet.
Note: Later versions of the following may work but haven't been tested.
Currently the buildenv tries to use the ones it finds in /usr/local:


	automake 1.10	(http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
	aclocal 1.10    (part of automake distribution)
	autoconf 2.6.0  (http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
	libtool 1.5.22  (http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
	m4 1.4.4 	(http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/)
	pkgconfig 0.19  (http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki)


BUILDING WORKSPACE WITH PRE-BUILT CONFIGURATION:
-----------------------------------------------

1. Move or copy the 'buildenv' directory to some place outside of the 
   this download bundle. 

2. Copy the distribution (in its current layout) into a folder named pcsclite
   under the buildenv folder you relocated, such that the top level files
   including the top level Makefile and autoconf configuration files
   are inside the pcsclite folder (ie. not in another folder underneath
   pcsclite).

3. $ cd buildenv/pcsclite

4. Issue the following commands to set up the autoconf environment:

   $ aclocal
   $ autoconf
   $ automake --add-missing
   $ autoreconf

   There may be some weird warnings, but unless they look particularly
   fatal they're probably OK.  You'll know for sure if it fails when you try
   to run make config next.  (Note: Any suggestions on how to clean
   this up to make the autoconf stuff work w/o errors are welcome).

5. Issue the following commands:

   $ cd ..
   $ make config
   $ make all

If all goes well buildenv/dist/<platform>/SolarisPCSC should be created.
To build on the alternate Solaris infrastructure (for example if you 
built the SPARC packages and want to build i386 packages in the same
workspace), you can log into a properly provisioned Solaris machine,
cd into buildenv, run make clean, make config, make all, which will
build the new package without destroying the one for the other
