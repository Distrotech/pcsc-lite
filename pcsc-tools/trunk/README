Some tools to be used with smart cards and PC/SC
================================================

This archive contains some tools usefull for a PC/SC user.
PC/SC lite [1] from MUSCLE [2].

The tools provided are:

- pcsc_scan (Ludovic Rousseau <ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>)
    regularly scans every PC/SC reader connected to the host
    if a card is inserted or removed a "line" is printed

    For example:

- ATR_analysis (Christophe Levantis and Ludovic Rousseau)
    Perl script used to parse the smart card ATR.
    This script is called (by default) by pcsc_scan

    This code was originally written by Christophe in August 2000 for a
    Perl wrapper using "TLP driver" (and not PC/SC) to access the
    smartcard.

- smartcard_list.txt (Ludovic Rousseau)
    This list contains ATR of some cards. The list is used by
    ATR_analysis to find a card model corresponding to the ATR.
    I took the initial list from SCEZ by Matthias Bruestle.

    Please send me (<ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>) any ATR and card
    description not included in the list.


- scriptor (Lionel Victor <lionel.victor@unforgettable.com>)
    A Perl script to send commands to a smart card. You can use a file
    containing the commands or stdin.


- gscriptor (Lionel Victor <lionel.victor@unforgettable.com>)
    A Perl script to send commands to a smart card with GTK-based
    graphical interface.


You will need the package pcsc-perl [3] to be able to use scriptor and
gscriptor.
