- include Apple patches and improvements (if possible/needed)

- power on the card _only_ if an application requests a connection
  see Alioth bug #301965
  That could be implemented by polling the reader only if an application
  requests it.

- use a callback from IFD handler to pcscd instead of polling to get the
  card status: better performance, possible lower power consumption

- allow to have pcscd and libpcsclite on two different machines.
  That would be needed to support remote PAM login.
  Maybe use unix2tcp (http://dizzy.roedu.net/unix2tcp/)

- manage power suspend/resume (in a laptop for example) and coordinate
  with the driver (when/if possible)
